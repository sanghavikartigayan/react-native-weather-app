# React Native Weather Application

The react native weather application enables user to explore the Austin Weather Forecast based on various period in a year.

## Design on Figma

The UI of the application was designed on Figma: [demo] (https://www.figma.com/proto/XQ4guDnryNxtibTy4g1G2s/Austin-Weather-App?node-id=1%3A23&scaling=scale-down), and then developed using REact native and react native elements.

## How to run the application

First download the application and then navigate to the folder directory to run the following command on the terminal.

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies and packages needed to run the project.

Next, run the application by running the following command
